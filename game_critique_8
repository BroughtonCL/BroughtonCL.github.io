 High

# Bugs
What bugs happened during your critique.
A cut scene bug. One of the characters are talking and their mouth does not move until after the speech has stopped (somewhat like a poorly dubbed movie). To fix this glitch, i restarted the game and there was no other issue.

# Final Thoughts
One paragraph summary of your overall viewpoint of the game.
I really enjoyed this game. Although I am not a first person shooter game player, I really enjoyed this one-from the architecture of the buildings to the story and especially the end, (it made M. Knight Shamalyan proud). The game play was easy to understand. I usually get confused ont he aim, but this was easy and yet fun.
