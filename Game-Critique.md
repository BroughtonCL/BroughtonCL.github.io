# Summary 
The SouthPark Game on the N64 is one  the most difficult games I have  ever  played.The object of the game is to save the town from the evil turkeys and aliens.

# Control
One hurdle was the controller,specifically the camera.It is extremely difficult to control as it is extremely sensitive. Refocusing is a challenge.
# Enemies
The enemies move quickly and there are generally groups of five to ten. Because of the scattering and not being able to focus, it is hard to beat these levels. If you are lucky, the enemies will get stuck with in the level structure.

# MulityPlayer
The multi player is fun because you are able to unlock other characters.However, the primitive map showing player location is difficult to follow.It is hard to figure where your opponent is.
# Overall,
I love the game for its nostalgic value, as I am a huge South Park fan. However, the control system makes it difficult to enjoy playing this game. The enemy AI makes it hard for the player to win. With its blitz attacks. Incorporating the cheat codes does make the game a little easier.
# Bugs
Enemies do get stuck instructure. Also, player does stall while chatging snowball for a very lengthy amount of time.
