# Synopsis
Help Stella defeat levels while popping bubbles. Some of these levels involve catching owls, releasing fairies, and freesing ghosts. All of which are done by removing bubbles. For extra points you build a house and maintain a property that gives you more tools to conquer the bubbles.

# Game Play Summary
Line up a bubble to latch onto a series of bubbles. When 3 or more are together, the bubbles disappear and clear a path. You are awarded points for the bubbles that you burst and those that are unused.

## Playability
High
### Single/Multiplayer
You play the game on your own but can share scores, give lives and see friends status'. You are also able to visit on line friends houses to accomplish mini quests.

### Controls
touch screen. Very easy to line up and release. Problem: Screen too sensitive and can release bubbles while you are still aiming.

# Bugs
None that were found

# Final Thoughts
I really enjoy this game. But it just keeps going pon with no end in sight. The one down fall is that you are only awarded 5 lives and need to wait for lives to replinish. Lives and extra bubble blasters are available, for purchase. That can be a little irritating for a "free" game. I understand they need to make money and gettingit from thew ads may not be enough. Despite this, as long at there are bubbles to break, I will keep playing!!!!
