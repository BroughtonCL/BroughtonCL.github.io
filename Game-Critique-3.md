The story is about a girl who had been a volunteer to be a part of Far Eden, a utopian and perfect colony.

She still has her 3 robots who assist her on missions.

# Game Play Summary
action adventure third person game. Joule ( the main character ibn the game) has her corebots. 
Each corebot is a different color and can battle enemies and level up. 
By fighting the same color robot and enemy, the bot inflicts more damage, thus gaining more points and upgrades.
## Playability
 Medicore 
# Single
Single offer story mode. In story there are mini challenges that allow you to gain more exp can level up the robots  and  weaponry.
# Multiplayer 
The game  offers  no multiplayer freatures.

### Controls
The comtrols are standard 3rd person shooter. The unique part is the robot companion. Each has a different ability and skill. 
# Bugs
The main character gets stuck in the terrainand you need to restart to fix this.
# Final Thoughts
Over all the story and the music are great, But the game itself is rather lackluster. 
Because of the open wolrd environment in the desert it does feel that it lags at times. I woulod recommend this only as a rental.
