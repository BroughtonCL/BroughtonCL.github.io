# Bugs
Sound bug-  the  audio delays and can look like a poorly over dubbed movie.  
# Final Thoughts
The game is fun. It allows you the opportunity to revisit old characters. The brought back the original soundtrack which is cool and yet 
can be annoying after awhile. The graphics aged pretty well, it doesnt look otdated despite the age of the game.
