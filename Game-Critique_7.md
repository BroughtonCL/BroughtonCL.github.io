# Synopsis
Regain your sacred acorns from  the throes of the Kitsune samurai. 

# Game Play Summary
The game play is top view maze. Using traps and magic to gainback your nuts while gouing through the maze. The game play reminded me of a pacman genre.

## Playability
Low

### Single/Multiplayer
Single-offer story mode campaign. It progressively gets harder the longer you play.
Offer a survival mode as well. 
Multi player-no option available during my test

### Controls
The controls are very similar to pac man with very few changes except for attacks and some navigation. 

# Bugs
I didnt encounter any bugs.
# Final Thoughts
I would not waste money on this game. The mazes grew more confusing as the game progressed. This game would be good as a free app based game.
