Heroku is a web application that allows a simple way to implement application infrastructure. By using pipelines you are able to create a work flow. In my opinion, this app would be best used for the steps of qa and final testing. Heroku offers the user the ability to have feedback. By developing your test, code, game, etc and sending information to heroku,  you are then given the results of your work. It also will configure new changes or configurations that offer a great testing environment to ensure game accuracy and flow. 
By maintaining previous versions, you are allowed the opportunity to go back should a current or new release or addition fail. This provides a great safety blanket by not having to restart from square one. 
Because Heroku can use any scripted language it is a lot easier to run  it without worrying about language configuration. 
I would use this system by creating my pipelines to the master branch.This app would take our simple codes and push them through quickly. After utilizing scrum options with other programmers,  we would load all changes and new additions into the app and see where our game is at. We would use this to rely on testing before we are able to launch. This would be quicker than human in house testing because we are able to get results quicker. While we will not completely elimunate the in house test, we can provide a good base to start. 
This would also be a good tool for upgrades and additions. Before launching and marketing we would be able to see the efficacy of what we were trying to accomplish. This tool provides us a more quality based product that we can launch.
