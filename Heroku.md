Heroku is a web application that allows a simple way to implement application infrastructure. By using pipelines you are able to create a work flow. In my opinion, this app would be best used for the steps of qa and final testing. Heroku offers the user the ability to have feedback. By developing your test, code, game, etc and sending information to heroku,  you are then given the results of your work. It also will configure new changes or configurations that offer a great testing environment to ensure game accuracy and flow.
